This book is a basic introduction to syntactic analysis in Hindi. Assuming no prior knowledge of the subject whatsoever, it is meant for students who are learning about syntax for the first time, especially those interested in SOV Asian languages. It provides a strong and easy-to-understand foundation for those who want to embark on a longer-term study of syntax. 

The book starts by explaining how general patterns help us understand sentence structure and word categories. It then moves on to more complex sentence structures, giving students plenty of exercises to practice and understand each concept before moving forward. The goal of the book is to introduce the basics of syntax clearly without going into complex issues of argumentation.
