I used to maintain a collection of LaTeX notes, but since they are now readily available online, I am not including them here. Most of the codes and ideas I used were inspired by the [cookbook](https://latex-cookbook.net/) website. For drawing mathematical symbols to use in LaTeX, refer to [Detexify.KireLabs website](https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html). Additionally, I have compiled some personal notes on a variety of different topics from mathematics and computational disciplines. You may download them here-

1. Notes on [Algebra](\assets\pdf\notes_algebra.pdf)
2. Notes on [Calculus](\assets\pdf\notes_calculus.pdf)
3. Notes on [NLP](\assets\pdf\notes_nlp.pdf)
