I am a doctoral researcher in the Department of Humanities at the Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi. My academic profile, including my CV, is accessible [here](https://iamalinguist.github.io/files/cv_22Nov2024.pdf).  

Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned an M.Tech. in Geoinformatics from IIT Bombay and an M.A. in Hindi from MGAHV, Wardha, motivated by a keen interest in linguistics.  

My research primarily addresses syntax and semantics, with my Ph.D. thesis titled *"A Modern Grammar of Hindi: A Formal Approach."* The core objective of my doctoral work is to develop a formal grammar for Hindi, integrating propositional logic, predicate logic, type theory, and temporal logic. To support this endeavor, I have designed and implemented a Python-based parsing tool for the grammar. I am currently preparing for my final viva, which is scheduled to take place before July 2025.  

My research adopts an interdisciplinary approach, intersecting discrete mathematics (including logic, sets, matrices, relations, and tree structures), language (SOV languages like Hindi), and computational linguistics (NLP). My primary focus is on leveraging formal mathematical frameworks to develop theoretical grammars for various languages. My secondary focus is on testing the ability of these grammars to enable machines to process and understand natural languages. In line with these interests, I enjoy collaborating with technologists, linguists, and innovators on projects exploring NLP applications, including large language models (LLMs).


Research Interests (Major to Minor):
======
1. Argument structure
2. Subject and object agreements
3. Case markers
4. Syntax and semantics of verbs (complex and conjugated verbs)
5. Grammatical theories
6. Natural language processing techniques (e.g., machine learning and deep learning models)
7. Mathematical concepts (e.g., discrete mathematics, linear algebra, etc.)


**Note** - Iâ€™m currently working on experimenting different grammars for Hindi Language. To understand a non-native perspective, I teach Hindi to non-native speakers worldwide and thoroughly enjoy engaging with individuals from diverse backgrounds. [[Check Website](https://heyhindi.web.app/)]
