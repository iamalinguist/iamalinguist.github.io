## LING101
`Introduction to Linguistics`
* Language and Communication – Definition of language, features of human communication, and comparison with animal communication.
* Phonetics and Phonology – Speech sounds, articulatory phonetics, phonemes, minimal pairs, and phonological rules.
* Morphology – Word structure, morphemes, derivation vs. inflection, and word formation processes.
* Syntax – Sentence structure, phrase types, and basic syntactic rules.
* Semantics and Pragmatics – Meaning in language, lexical semantics, context and implicature.
* Sociolinguistics – Language variation, dialects, registers, and social factors in language use.
* Historical Linguistics – Language change, comparative methods, and language families.
* Psycholinguistics – Language acquisition, comprehension, and cognitive processing of language.
* Typology and Universals – Linguistic diversity, word order typologies, and cross-linguistic generalizations.

## LING201
`Introduction to Syntax`
* Basic Syntactic Concepts – Sentence, phrase, and clause distinctions.
* Constituency Tests – Substitution, movement, coordination, and deletion as tools for determining structure.
* Phrase Structure Rules – Building tree diagrams, understanding NP, VP, PP, etc.
* X-bar Theory – Introduction to the X-bar schema, complements vs. adjuncts.
* Syntactic Categories and Functions – Identifying subjects, objects, predicates, etc.
* Word Order – Basic word order patterns (SVO, SOV, etc.) and their implications.
* Movement – Basics of transformational rules, wh-movement, and head movement.
* Agreement and Case – Subject-verb agreement, nominative and accusative case assignment.
* Cross-Linguistic Variation – Language-specific syntactic structures, and comparison across languages.

* Universal Grammar (UG) – The notion of an innate grammatical framework.
* Deep Structure vs. Surface Structure – Understanding transformations in syntax.
* Binding Theory – Principles A, B, and C; anaphors, pronouns, and referential expressions.
* Theta Theory – Thematic roles (agent, patient, theme, etc.) and argument structures.
* Government and Binding – Historical concepts of government, c-command, and locality.
* Minimalist Program – Economy of derivation and representation, and core notions like Merge.
* Syntactic Parameters – Head directionality, null subjects, and other parameterized differences.
* Formalism and Tree Structures – Detailed analyses of syntax diagrams using modern theory.

## LING401
`Theories of Grammar`
* Traditional Grammar – Prescriptive rules and grammar traditions.
* Structural Grammar – Bloomfieldian linguistics, and the focus on forms and patterns.
* Transformational-Generative Grammar (TGG) – Overview of Chomskyan theories and their evolution.
* Functional Grammar – Role of semantics and pragmatics in syntactic structures.
* Dependency Grammar – Relationships between words, focusing on syntactic dependencies.
* Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) – Interactions between lexical entries and syntactic structures.
* Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) – Feature structures, unification-based approaches.
* Construction Grammar – Grammar as a collection of form-meaning pairings (constructions).
* Comparative Overview of Theories – Strengths and weaknesses of different models.
