## What is Transformational Generative Grammar(TGG)?
- TGG This is a specific type of [generative grammar](). Introduced by Chomsky in his book "Syntactic Structures" (1957).

- It introduces transformations ‚Äî operations that convert one syntactic structure into another. For example, converting:

"John is eating an apple." ‚Üí "Is John eating an apple?" (yes-no question)

- It emphasizes the difference between:
  - Deep structure (basic sentence structure)
  - Surface structure (what we actually say/hear)

- Chomsky talked about these structurs (Deep Structure, Surface Structure) especially in the **Standard Theory (1965)**, while discussing Transformational-Generative Grammar (TGG).

## üå± Difference between Deep and Surface Structure?
| Term               | Meaning                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Deep Structure | The *abstract, underlying form* of a sentence that captures its *core meaning* and *basic grammatical relations*. |
| Surface Structure | The *final, actual form* of a sentence that we *speak or hear*, after transformations are applied. |

<br>

üå± Why Two Levels?
- Different **surface forms** can express the **same underlying meaning**.
- Some sentences have **ambiguous surface forms** that deep structure helps clarify.

## üß† Examples

**A. English Examples**

#### 1. Active and Passive Voice

- **Active**:  
  *The cat chased the mouse.*  
- **Passive**:  
  *The mouse was chased by the cat.*

> ‚úÖ **Same Deep Structure**: "cat chases mouse"  
> ‚úÖ **Different Surface Structures** due to transformation.

<br>

#### 2. Question Formation

- **Statement**:  
  *You are eating an apple.*  
- **Question**:  
  *Are you eating an apple?*

> ‚úÖ Deep structure stays the same.  
> ‚úÖ Surface structure changes through auxiliary movement.

**A. Hindi Examples**

#### 1. Active-Passive

- **Active**:  
  *‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§®‡•á ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§§‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ‡§æ‡•§*  
- **Passive**:  
  *‡§∏‡•Ä‡§§‡§æ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ‡•Ä ‡§ó‡§à‡•§*

> ‚úÖ Deep structure: Ram sees Sita  
> ‚úÖ Surface structure: Changes with voice

<br>

#### 2. Question Formation

- **Statement**:  
  *‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§ú‡§º‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ú‡§æ ‡§∞‡§π‡•á ‡§π‡•ã‡•§*  
- **Question**:  
  *‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§ú‡§º‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ú‡§æ ‡§∞‡§π‡•á ‡§π‡•ã?*

> ‚úÖ Deep structure = "You are going to the market"  
> ‚úÖ Surface structure = Adds "‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ" to form question

#### üîÅ Summary (Deep and Surface)

| Feature              | Deep Structure                        | Surface Structure                      |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Level                | Abstract / Mental grammar              | Spoken / Written form                   |
| Captures             | Core meaning, basic roles (who did what) | How sentence appears                    |
| Involves             | Phrase structure rules                 | Transformations (e.g., move, insert)    |
| Example (English)    | "you are eating an apple"              | "Are you eating an apple?"              |
| Example (Hindi)      | "‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§ú‡§º‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ú‡§æ ‡§∞‡§π‡•á ‡§π‡•ã"                  | "‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§ú‡§º‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ú‡§æ ‡§∞‡§π‡•á ‡§π‡•ã?"              |

## Phrase Structures
When linguists talk about "phrase structure," they are referring to the hierarchical organization of words into larger units (phrases) within a sentence. This concept is central to Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG), also known as Constituency Grammar.

<br>

#### üîπ Which grammatical theory is it affiliated with?
Phrase structure is affiliated primarily with Transformational Generative Grammar(TGG), especially:
<br>

- #### 1. Chomsky's Transformational-Generative Grammar (TGG) ‚Äì 
  - Introduced in the 1950s by Noam Chomsky.
  - Early models like the Standard Theory (1965) emphasized phrase structure rules.
  - Chomsky introduced deep structure and surface structure, both built on phrase structure.

- #### 2. X-bar theory ‚Äì 
  - A refinement of phrase structure rules that introduced intermediate phrase levels (e.g., X‚Ä≤ or X-bar), ensuring a uniform structure across all phrases (NPs, VPs, etc.).

- #### 3. Minimalist Program (1990s onward) ‚Äì 
  - While it reduces reliance on phrase structure rules, it still assumes hierarchical phrase structure via Merge operations.
