## What is TGG?
- Transformational Generative Grammar(TGG) is a specific type of <a href="2025-06-14-generative-grammar.md">generative grammar</a>. Introduced by Chomsky in his book "Syntactic Structures" (1957).
<br>

- It introduces transformations ‚Äî operations that convert one syntactic structure into another. For example, converting: "John is eating an apple." ‚Üí "Is John eating an apple?" (yes-no question)
<br>

- It makes use of "phrase structures". When linguists talk about phrase structure, they are referring to the hierarchical organization of words into larger units (phrases) within a sentence. Thus, this concept provides use of alternative names to this viz. Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG), also known as Constituency Grammar.

Which other grammatical theory is it affiliated with? -> **X-bar theory** (A refinement of phrase structure rules that introduced intermediate phrase levels (e.g., X‚Ä≤ or X-bar), ensuring a uniform structure across all phrases (NPs, VPs, etc.).), **Minimalist Program** (While it reduces reliance on phrase structure rules, it still assumes hierarchical phrase structure via Merge operations.)
```

- Chomsky introduced deep structure (basic sentence structure) and surface structure (what we actually say/hear), both built on phrase structure in TGG. Chomsky talked about these structurs especially in the **Standard Theory (1965)**, while discussing TGG.

üå± **What are the differences between Deep and Surface Structure?**

| Term               | Meaning                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Surface Structure | The *final, actual form* of a sentence that we *speak or hear*, after transformations are applied. |
| Deep Structure | The *abstract, underlying form* of a sentence that captures its *core meaning* and *basic grammatical relations*. |

<br>

üå± **Why Two Levels?**
- Some sentences may have **ambiguous surface forms** that deep structure helps clarify.
- Different **surface forms** can express the **same underlying meaning**.

<br>

üå± **Examples**

A. English Examples

#### 1. Active and Passive Voice

- **Active**: *The cat chased the mouse.*  
- **Passive**: *The mouse was chased by the cat.*

> ‚úÖ **Same Deep Structure**: "cat chases mouse"  
> ‚úÖ **Different Surface Structures** due to transformation.

<br>

#### 2. Question Formation

- **Statement**: *You are eating an apple.*  
- **Question**: *Are you eating an apple?*

> ‚úÖ Deep structure stays the same.  
> ‚úÖ Surface structure changes through auxiliary movement.

B. Hindi Examples

#### 1. Active-Passive

- **Active**: *‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§®‡•á ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§§‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ‡§æ‡•§*  
- **Passive**: *‡§∏‡•Ä‡§§‡§æ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ‡•Ä ‡§ó‡§à‡•§*

> ‚úÖ Deep structure: Ram sees Sita  
> ‚úÖ Surface structure: Changes with voice

<br>

#### 2. Question Formation

- **Statement**: *‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§ú‡§º‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ú‡§æ ‡§∞‡§π‡•á ‡§π‡•ã‡•§*  
- **Question**: *‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§ú‡§º‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ú‡§æ ‡§∞‡§π‡•á ‡§π‡•ã?*

> ‚úÖ Deep structure = "You are going to the market"  
> ‚úÖ Surface structure = Adds "‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ" to form question
