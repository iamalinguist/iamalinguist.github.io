Understanding what constitutes a subject in linguistics is a deceptively complex issue, especially when examined across the world's languages. Unlike many grammatical terms (like verb or noun), "subject" does not have a universally agreed-upon definition in theoretical or descriptive linguistics. This confusion stems from the fact that languages vary widely in how they encode grammatical relations and in what they treat as "subject-like" elements.

In syntactic theory, core subject properties are diagnostic behaviors typically used to identify the subject in a sentence. The main ones are:


{% tabs subjecthood_tests %}

{% tab subjecthood_tests Control of PRO %}
<div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px; border: 2px solid #007bff;">
Subject controls the understood subject in non-finite clauses.
<br>
→ Ram [PRO khelne gaya]. ("Ram went [to play].")
</div>
{% endtab %}


{% tab subjecthood_tests Reflexive Binding %}
<div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px; border: 2px solid #007bff;">
Subject can bind reflexive pronouns.
<br>
→ Ram-ne apne aap ko dekha. ("Ram saw himself.")
</div>
{% endtab %}

{% tab subjecthood_tests Raising %}
<div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px; border: 2px solid #007bff;">
Subject can raise from embedded clauses.
<br>
→ Ram lagta hai [_ bimaar hai]._ ("Ram seems to be sick.")
</div>
{% endtab %}

{% tab subjecthood_tests Agreement %}
<div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px; border: 2px solid #007bff;">
Subject usually triggers verb agreement.
<br>
→ Ladki ja rahi hai. ("The girl is going.") → agreement in number/gender.
</div>
{% endtab %}

{% tab subjecthood_tests Subject-Oriented Adverbials %}
<div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px; border: 2px solid #007bff;">
Some adverbs refer only to the subject.
<br>
→ Ram jaan-bujhkar gira. ("Ram fell on purpose.") → “on purpose” must modify the subject.
</div>
{% endtab %}

{% tab subjecthood_tests Discourse Prominence %}
<div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px; border: 2px solid #007bff;">
Subject tends to be the topic or focus.
<br>
→ Often sentence-initial in neutral word order.
</div>
{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

These tests are used to identify subjecthood even when case marking is non-nominative, especially in Hindi.

#### 1. Syntactic Minimalism and Argument Structure
Mohanan (1994) presented a pivotal generative account where subjecthood in Hindi is not determined by surface case (like nominative), but by **argument hierarchy** and **syntactic configuration**. She argued that ergative-marked arguments (e.g., *"Ram-ne"* in *"Ram-ne roti khayi"*) are **true syntactic subjects** despite their non-nominative case.

#### 2. Non-nominative Subjects and Voice Syntax
Montaut (2008, 2013) developed a typology of *non-canonical subjecthood* in Hindi, showing that **oblique and dative-marked arguments** often display subject properties—control, binding, and topicality—even when they are not agents.

#### 3. Subject as a Gradient, Not a Category
Ethan Poole (2016) proposed that subjecthood in Hindi is **property-based and gradient**. He showed that ergative or dative arguments may lack some properties (e.g., agreement) but retain others (e.g., control over PRO).

#### 4. Morphological Ergative & Aspectual Condition
Finley (2010) argued that the presence of *-ne* is conditioned by **aspect**, not subjecthood. In Hindi, the perfective aspect determines ergative alignment, breaking down a direct link between morphology and syntactic function.

<br>

#### 5. Comparative Syntax: Diachrony and Function
Butt (2012) traced the evolution of the *ne-marker* from a **spatial marker to a subject marker**, suggesting that subjecthood in Hindi is **historically emergent** and functionally aligned.

#### 6. Subjecthood Tests in Hindi
Fatma (2023) applied classical diagnostics such as **binding, control, and adverbial orientation** to show that Hindi licenses **multiple subject types**, including ergative, dative, and oblique arguments.

> Reference: Fatma, Z. (2023). *Non-nominative Subjects in Kannauji and Hindi-Urdu*. | 📖 [PDF](https://linguistics.uok.edu.in/Files/f6ec3740-422d-4ac1-9f52-ddfe2cffcb28/Journal/e0ccce10-07e2-4088-a575-28b943e4ece8.pdf)

<br>

#### 7. Karaka Theory and Semantic Alignment
Debnath (2021) used **Paninian grammar and pregroup logic** to show that karaka relations in Hindi reflect **semantic roles**, which sometimes override morphological case in determining subject-like behavior.

> Reference: Debnath, A. (2021). *A Pregroup Representation and Analysis of Hindi Syntax*. | 📖 [PDF](https://cdn.iiit.ac.in/cdn/web2py.iiit.ac.in/research_centres/publications/download/mastersthesis.pdf)

<br>

#### 8. Binding Theory and Voice⁰
Bhatia & Poole (2016) showed that **Voice⁰**, the head that introduces external arguments, determines **subject-oriented adverbial behavior**. Thus, subjecthood in Hindi is derivationally encoded, not simply morphological.

> Reference: Bhatia, S., & Poole, E. (2016). *Deriving Subject and Antisubject Orientation*. | 📖 [PDF](https://ojs.ub.uni-konstanz.de/jsal/index.php/fasal/article/view/104/62)

✅ **Final Synthesis:** A Research Proposition on Subjecthood in Hindi- Drawing from these foundational works, I propose the following **testable definition**:

> **In Hindi, a subject is any argument that satisfies a critical mass of syntactic and semantic diagnostics — including control over PRO, binding of reflexives, raising behavior, subject-oriented adverbial licensing, and discourse prominence — regardless of morphological case or surface position.**

This means **subjecthood is not tied to nominative or ergative morphology**, but instead arises from **syntactic behavior and functional prominence**.

| Ergative                | *Ravi-ne roti khayi*            | ✔ Control, ✔ Subject role    |
| Dative (Experiencer)    | *Mujhe gussa aaya*              | ✔ Reflexive Binding          |
| Oblique (Control Test)  | *Mujhse apne aap par vishwas...*| ✔ Reflexive Binding          |
