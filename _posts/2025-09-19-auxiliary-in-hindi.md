## Primary role: 

### Tense/Aspect anchoring
Auxiliaries license **tense/aspect anchoring**. Finite clauses in Hindi need an auxiliary (*hai*, *thā*, *hogā*, etc.).  That auxiliary **anchors tense/aspect** (present, past, future, progressive, perfective, etc.).  

Without it, sentences like:

- *rām caltā*  
- *rām nahī̃ caltā*  

feel incomplete, almost like a nominal predicate or a fragment.

## 2. Secondary role:

### Licensing negation
Auxiliaries also **license negation**.

Example:  
- *rām nahī̃ chaltā hai* → grammatical  
- *rām nahī̃ chaltā* → ungrammatical (clause collapses)

Here, *nahī̃* is targeting *chaltā*. But without *hai*, the clause cannot close off properly. The auxiliary provides the **tense/aspect frame** that lets negation scope over a full proposition.  

So, auxiliaries don’t *create* negation. They **make space for it** by supplying clausal scaffolding.  
That’s why the literature often says “auxiliaries license negation” — it’s shorthand for:  
> Negation needs a finite clause, and auxiliaries are what make the clause finite.

## Summary
- **Without auxiliary** → fragment, predicate-only, non-finite  
- **With auxiliary** → full clause, finite, truth-evaluable

## FAQ

**Q: What is a nominal predicate?**  
A nominal predicate = a predicate made of a noun or adjective (not a verb).  

In Hindi, predicates can be formed from:

- **Verbs** → *rām caltā hai* “Ram walks” (verbal predicate)  
- **Adjectives** → *rām bīmār hai* “Ram is sick” (adjectival predicate)  
- **Nouns** → *rām ācārya hai* “Ram is a teacher” (nominal predicate)
