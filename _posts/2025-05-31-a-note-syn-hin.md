Hindi, being a relatively underexplored language in formal syntactic theory, presents rich opportunities to test, refine, or reformulate syntactic assumptions. The intersection of [Syntax](https://iamalinguist.github.io/blog/2025/a-note-ling-syn/) and Hindi is a fertile ground for both theoretical innovation and empirical depth. Here are emerging or underexploited areas of research that can guide seminars and research in the coming five years:

<br>

#### 1. Scrambling and Word Order Flexibility
Hindi's relatively free word order, driven by scrambling, offers a natural laboratory to explore syntactic operations beyond English SVO rigidity. Key questions involve:

* What are the constraints on scrambling?
* Does scrambling have interpretive effects (e.g., focus, topic, contrast)?
* Can Hindi scrambling challenge minimalist assumptions about movement?

<br>

#### 2. Complex Predicates and Light Verbs

Hindi extensively uses light verb constructions (e.g., *khā liyā*, *likh diyā*). These can be used to explore:

* Argument structure variation
* Verb serialization and compositional semantics
* Syntactic projection of aspectual and agentive features

<br>

#### 3. Differential Object Marking (DOM)
The optional accusative marker *-ko* in Hindi offers rich data for:
* The syntax of case marking
* Animacy and definiteness effects
* Typological parallels and theoretical challenges to Case Theory

<strong>Note:</strong> In DOM, the term "differential" refers to the phenomenon where not all direct objects in a language are marked in the same way—some receive special morphological marking (like the Hindi postposition -ko) based on certain features of the object.

In Hindi, for example:
<ul>
  <li>Maine ek kitāb paṛhī. (I read a book.) → kitāb is unmarked.</li>
  <li>Maine Rām-ko dekha. (I saw Ram.) → Rām is marked with -ko.</li>
</ul>  

The difference (hence “differential”) depends on properties such as:
<ul>
    <li>Animacy: animate objects are more likely to be marked.</li>
    <li>Definiteness: definite/specific objects tend to be marked.</li>
    <li>Topicality or affectedness: marked if the object is emphasized or topical.</li>
</ul>
<br>
So, “differential” captures the idea that *object marking is not uniform* —it varies *systematically* depending on semantic or pragmatic features.

#### 4. Agreement Patterns and Feature Geometry
Hindi displays interesting agreement asymmetries, especially with ergative constructions and object agreement in perfective clauses:

* What does Hindi agreement reveal about the directionality of Agree?
* Can Hindi challenge standard assumptions about phi-features?

<br>

#### 5. Wh-questions and Clause Typing
Hindi employs sentence-final wh-elements and lacks overt complementizers in many embedded clauses:
* What syntactic mechanisms allow clause-typing?
* Can Hindi offer a different model for interrogative clause formation?

<br>

#### 6. Negation, Modality, and Polarity Items

The interaction between negation (*nahī̃*), polarity-sensitive items, and modals in Hindi has implications for:
* Syntax-semantics interface
* Scope ambiguity
* Licensing conditions for NPIs and their syntactic positions

<br>

#### 7. Relative Clauses and Correlatives
Hindi uses correlative structures (e.g., *jo...vo...*) rather than internally headed relative clauses:
* What does this mean for head-dependency relations?
* Can correlatives inform syntactic theories of left-periphery or CP structure?

<br>

#### 8. Syntax of Evidentiality and Reported Speech
Hindi uses lexical items (e.g., *kya*, *to*, *lagta hai*) to express epistemic status and source of information. Studying this domain syntactically and semantically can enrich:
* The theory of propositional attitude verbs
* The role of syntax in evidential interpretation

<br>

#### 9. Tense-Aspect Systems and Perfectivity
Hindi's split ergativity and aspect-driven agreement offer critical data for:
* Temporal anchoring in clause structure
* Aspectual auxiliary syntax
* Interface of morphology and syntax

<br>

#### 10. Formal Grammar of Hindi (LFG, HPSG, CCG, Minimalism)
Developing formally annotated treebanks and rule sets for Hindi using modern grammar formalisms will contribute to both linguistic theory and computational modeling.

### Conclusion: A Five-Year Research Vision
 I welcome scholars and researchers interested in collaborating on these ten topics. This work will adhere strictly to the outlined ideas and will further involve:  

- **Organizing thematic seminars and workshops** to explore these topics in depth.  
- **Developing formal grammars of Hindi**, incorporating syntactic frameworks such as Minimalism, LFG, or CCG.  
- **Contributing to the creation of computational resources** that enhance Hindi syntax analysis.  
- **Examining and, if necessary, challenging Eurocentric syntactic models** by presenting data-driven modifications based on Hindi.  

I look forward to meaningful collaborations that advance research in these areas.
